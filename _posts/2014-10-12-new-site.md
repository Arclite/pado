title: That New Site Smell
---

As you may know if you follow me [on Twitter](http://twitter.com/Arclite), I left my full-time job at Newsy back in May, and have been working on bringing back my old company, [Cocoatype](http://cocoatype.com). I'm happy to say that things have been going great on that front. Today, I'm relaunching both the Cocoatype website and my own personal website.

My personal website is now much cleaner, and actually has more than one page. I've also moved my rarely-updated blog from Tumblr to the site itself, using a [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) backend.  Mostly just for the heck of it, I've also included my [résumé](/resume); it's now fully HTML-generated so I can update even the paper copy quicker than I could before.

Cocoatype's website, on the other hand, has gotten a far more substantial upgrade. With Cocoatype having a new focus on doing consulting rather than building App Store apps, the site had to change accordingly. You can go there to check out Cocoatype's range of [app development services](http://cocoatype.com/services) or the [work we've done so far](http://cocoatype.com/portfolio).

Cocoatype's new consulting focus isn't to say that I’m fully abandoning the idea of building apps for myself. In fact, I’m hoping to have something to announce in that vein relatively shortly. However, it isn't in the cards quite yet.

I’m excited about these two new websites not for their actual contents or the mediocre traffic they might bring, but rather for their symbolic value. As it stands right now, I'm managing to make a living on something that I've created on my own for the first time in my life. I don't expect it to last forever, but it's been my dream since a young age and I'm happy to finally see it taking shape.
