## Profile

I'm a software developer who specializes in the creation of mobile applications. I've been building iOS apps since the App Store launched in 2008, and have since shipped apps for both the Android and Windows Phone platforms as well.

##Experience

### Founder/Developer @ Cocoatype, LLC <span class="duration">2008 &ndash; Present</span>

In 2008, I founded Cocoatype to build consumer software applications. Doing so, I became very familiar with developing for both Mac OS X and iOS. I worked directly with top-notch designers, helping me learn how to make an app that works for users.

Since 2014, Cocoatype does mobile and web application contracting. I am responsible for everything from working with clients to determine requirements to delivering the final product.

### Director of App Development @ Newsy <span class="duration"> May 2011 &ndash; May 2014</span>

At Newsy, I was responsible for the development of video news applications for mobile platforms, including iOS, Android, and Windows Phone. I also built several in-house apps to improve the workflow of coworkers in other departments.

As director, I worked directly with other department directors at Newsy to coordinate efforts throughout the development process. During my tenure, Newsy shipped several new applications, many major updates, and prototypes for entirely new product lines.

### Intern @ Apple, Inc. <span class="duration">Summer 2010</span>

During my internship at Apple, I worked in the OS X System Applications department. My responsibilities included setting up testing environments for the team I worked with, performing miscellaneous other development tasks, creating presentations, and participating in inter-team discussions.

## Skills

I have significant experience with iOS application development. I'm also well-versed with both the Android and Windows Phone platforms. My experience on these platforms isn't just technical expertise&mdash;I'm familiar with what users are looking for out of a high-quality app on each platform.

I also have strong interpersonal skills. For most of my career, I've worked closely with people from other disciplines. I'm able to communicate technical details to non-technical people in order to reach an understanding.
